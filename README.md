# Go Live Pro

## WHY THIS PROJECT

### My motivation

This is the final project for CS50 Harvard online program 
after nine weeks of studying hard between learning the 
essentials of programming with C to the advanced 
topics in C programming to more modern language 
yes it is python and from here we learned more 
about frameworks and here i loved Flask.

### Problem to solve

I have a GoPro hero 9 camera I was wondering 
how I can download my media or stream without 
a USB cable, and after searching around the 
internet I found nothing, and here the idea 
comes up to me about how I can make a web app
 to automate and stream by GoPro 9 without cable.

### What I learned
- Manage and build a web app from the ground 
with MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.

- How to use blueprints, how to use more than one language
to build one app.
- Flask was really nice practice for me
to use SQLalchemy, blueprints, hash passwords, dealing with sessions.
- I learned the logic of HTTP requests and manipulating DOM, sending requests between 
**Frontend** and **Backend** without refreshing the page using 
JQuery and Javascript and finally how to use
OpenCV library.

## Project Description

It is a Flask web app that gives you the power to control your 
Go Pro Hero camera without wire, just connect your camera
via wifi and you can change camera settings, take photos,
the shot video even stream live online, by just hitting a button
from the website.

I used python as the main Backend language with Flask
as a framework, for the Frontend Javascript and JQuery library
of course, CSS and Bootstrap make the website looks joyful.


## How to Use Go-Live Pro

- Connect your GoPro Hero camera via wifi and you can do 
   that in these steps:
   1. Connect your camera to **GoPro Quik** application on
   your smartphone and pair it.
   2. In **GoPro Quik** hit **Control Your GoPro** button,
   which will trigger the camera wifi to be open and be able
   to find it by your Laptop or Pc.
   3. On your machine search for new networks available,
   you should find your **GoPro Camera** and you are good
   to go.
- Open [GoProHero](https://www.example.com) 
- Make an account by registering, if you have
   one already just log in.
- go to GoLive! and you will find buttons where you can
  control your camera and change settings.
- You can go live stream here [GoProHero](https://www.example.com) 
  stop the stream by the **Stop** button you can start it again
  by clicking on **Start**.
- you can start recording your stream by clicking **Start Record**
  

## Challenges I faced

- the lack of references to use GoPro for Livestream was my first
issue and I kept taking the API examples as reference.

- as new to python language I had to learn during working on the project,
  using Object Oriented programming was a real challenge for me,
  the issues and errors I faced it makes me more knowledgeable
  how to fix this type of error in the future.
