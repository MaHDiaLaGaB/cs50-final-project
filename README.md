# Go Live Pro

## WHY THIS PROJECT

### My motivation

This is final project for CS50 Harvard online program 
after nine weeks studying hard bitween learning the 
essinsials of programming with C to the advanced 
topics in C programming to more modern language 
yes it is python and from here we learned more 
about frameworks and here i loved Flask.

### Problem to solve

I have a GoPro hero 9 camera I was wondering 
how I can download my media or stream without 
a USB cable, and after searching around the 
internet I found nothing, and here the idea 
comes up to me about how I can make a web app
 to automate and stream by GoPro 9 without cable.

### What i learned
what I learned: manage and build a web app from the ground 
with MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure,
how to use blueprints, how to use more than one language
to build one app, Flask was really nice practice for me
to use SQLalchemy, I learned the logic of HTTP requests and manipulating DOM, sending requests between 
frontend and backend without refreshing the page using 
JQuery and Javascript and finally how to use
OpenCV library.

## Project Description

It is Flask web app give you the power to control your 
Go Pro Hereo camera without wire, just connect your camera
via wifi and you can change camera settings, take photo,
shot video even streamlive online, by just hitting a button
from the website.

I used python as the main Backend language with Flask
as framwork, for the Frontend Javascript and JQuery library
of corse CSS and Bootstrap to make the website looks joynfull.


## How to Use Go Live Pro

- Connect your GoPro Hero camera via wifi and you can do 
   that in this steps:
   1. Connect your camera to **GoPro Quik** application on
   your smartphone and pair it.
   2. In **GoPro Quik** hit **Control Your GoPro** button,
   that will trigger the camera wifi to be open and be able
   to find it by your Laptop or Pc.
   3. On your machine search for new networks avalible,
   you should find your **GoPro Camera** and you are good
   to go.
- Open [GoProHero](https://www.example.com) 
- Make an account by registring,if you have
   one already just login.
- go to GoLive! and you will find buttons where you can
  control your camera and change settings.
- You can go live stream here [GoProHero](https://www.example.com) 
  stop the stream by **Stop** button you can start it again
  by clicking on **Start**.
- you can start recording your stream by clicking **Start Record**

 

the idea is how to use my gopro camera without usb caple so after degging onling i found an repo in github for some guy named Konrad and i found really usefull API,
the application does gave you the power to control your gopro camera without caple at all after u connect your camera via wifi, and you can stream online too.


this is my first project ever in the world of programming i feel more comfy using python language so thats why i used Flask as framwark, to build flask webapp i need to make HTML templates to render the pages for the user and i used bootstrab starter template to make my life easer i edited using CSS, SQLite was my choice to manage database and SQlalchemy as rm, i used javascript and jquery to make fast contact between the frontend and the backend without loading the page, Opencv and Konrad Api was the nerve for this project.

lack of refrenc was my biggiest challeng, using GoPro camera as source for the stream was really hard choice,
the first issue i faced was
