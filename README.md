# Go Live Pro

## WHY THIS PROJECT

### My motivation

why i build this project: it is final project for CS50 Harvard online program after nine weeks studying hard bitween learning the essinsials of programming with c to the advanced topics in c programming to more modern language yes it python in the lask week was aboute frameworks and here i loved Flask.

problem my project solve: i have GoPro camera hero 9 i was wundring how i can download my media or stream without USB cable, and after searching around the internet i found nothing, and here the idea come up to me about how i can make an webapp to automate and stream by GoPro 9 without cable.

what i learned: manage and build webapp from ground, how to connect files how to use more than one language to bild one app, Flask was really nice practice for me to use data base, logic of HTTP requests, jinja syntax for the templates, and finally how to use konrad API that will be the nerv for this web app


the idea is how to use my gopro camera without usb caple so after degging onling i found an repo in github for some guy named Konrad and i found really usefull API,
the application does gave you the power to control your gopro camera without caple at all after u connect your camera via wifi, and you can stream online too.


this is my first project ever in the world of programming i feel more comfy using python language so thats why i used Flask as framwark, to build flask webapp i need to make HTML templates to render the pages for the user and i used bootstrab starter template to make my life easer i edited using CSS, SQLite was my choice to manage database and SQlalchemy as rm, i used javascript and jquery to make fast contact between the frontend and the backend without loading the page, Opencv and Konrad Api was the nerve for this project.

lack of refrenc was my biggiest challeng, using GoPro camera as source for the stream was really hard choice,
the first issue i faced was
